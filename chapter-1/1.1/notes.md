# Elements of Programming

A powerful programming language is not only about instructing a computer to perform tasks but also about 
providing a framework on organizing complex ideas about processes.

Every powerful programming language provides the following three mechanisms to acheive the above:
* Primitive Expressions i.e. a way of defining the simplest entities,
* A way to combination by which complex elements can be represented by combining simpler ones,
* A way of abstraction by which complex elements can be represnted & edited as a single unit. 

Expressions can be as simple as:
 400; 
 & the js interpreter responds by priting back the same output i.e. 400,
or they can contain other expressions as components i.e. 
100+300;
again the interpreter prints 400
such expressions are called **combinations**.

Interpreter operates the same way even with complex expressions i.e. it reads the statement, evaluates the statement and prints the result.
This behavior is expressed by saying that interpreter operates in a **read-evaluate-print** loop.
